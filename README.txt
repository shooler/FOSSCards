Setup:
If it doesn't run initially try running the install file first,
if that doesnt work, just run pip install dropbox

Steps:
Select a course when the window boots (probably OS-FINAL-REVIEW)
All files in that course folder are downloaded (flash card files)
You can go through all the cards, if you get it right press right, wrong press wrong
(Right removes the card from the stack, wrong places it at the end)
Flip the card over to see the answer or go back to the question
Restart from base or shuffle the deck up with the buttons up top
On the bottom right you can see how many flashcards are left in the stack

You may find a card is wrong, you can change it then sync it back up to the dropbox so it will be
	correct for everyone. Heres how:
	-You can see which file the question is from on the bottom left, where it say "From: example.txt"	
	-Under file create/edit Notecards, click File -> Select File, then choose the file where you found the
		error.
	-To edit, just select a file then it will populate all the cards made, you can pull from the list
		with the "<" button to the edit area, or put it into the stack with the ">" button.
		just save it when you are done (only save as at the moment)
	-Once done, on the main window, hit File -> Sync Course Files
		-By default the program will detect changes between the dropbox files and the local files,
			a popup will ask you if you want to overwrite it in DB, you can change these settings
			under the Settings option on the main window.

You can also just create new Flashcard files by not selecting a file then saving it as a new file.
