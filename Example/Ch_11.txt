{"Hows does the SCAN disk scheduling policy work?": "Scans in one direction until it reaches the end or there are no more requests in that direction, then starts moving back down", "How does shortest service time first (SSTF) work?": "Selects the disk I/O request that requires the least movement of the disk arm from its current position.", "What is a disk cache?": "A buffer in main memory for disk sectors. Contains a copy of some of the sectors on the disk.", "How do you get access time?": "Seek time + rotational delay", "What does RAID stand for?": "Redundant array of independent disks", "How does the C-SCAN disk scheduling policy work?": "When the last track has been visited in one direction, the arm is returned to the opposite end of the disk and the scan begins again.", "What are the 4 main disk scheduling policies?": "1. FIFO\n2. SSTF (shortest seek time first)\n3. SCAN\n4. C-SCAN (circular scan)", "What is seek time?": "The time it takes to position the head at the track"}
